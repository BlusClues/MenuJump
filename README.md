Menu Jump was created for a weekend-long game jam held by the TRU Game Development Club around Christmas in December 2024.
The theme was “Frozen”, with subthemes of "time freezing" and "menu-based interactions".

Our game tied for 1st place, and it was an incredible experience — this project was my first real dive into the Godot Engine, and my friend’s very first experience with coding in general.

Gameplay!
Use the game's UI to Platform your way through the level. 

Press the Escape key on your keyboard to spawn the menu buttons which you can use as platforms that you can place around the level progress. 
When the boxes are red, you are able to move them with your mouse and when you click escape again you are able to use them as walkable platforms.

As this was a game jam with 2 relative noobies to Godot. Most of our time was spent learning the code base and syntax.
Because of that, many of the assets used within the project are from tutorials or other free online assets from sources like Itch.io. However many have been redesigned or repurposed to fit the theme!

You can access a playable version of this project by heading to my Itch.io page: https://blusclues.itch.io/menujump

Thank you and I hope you enjoy playing as much as we enjoyed making the project!
